# Data Bytes Research Project

## Overview
The *Data Bytes Research Project* focuses on analyzing student performance factors using a cleaned dataset. This project involves data loading, preprocessing, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

## Files in This Project
- **Cleaned_StudentPerformanceFactors.xlsx** – The cleaned dataset containing student performance factors.
- **Data Bytes Code.txt** – The Python script for data processing and visualization.
- **Data Bytes Report.docx** – A detailed report summarizing the analysis and findings.

## Instructions

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib

#### Installation
Run the following command to install dependencies:
```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

### 2. Running the Code
1. Ensure the dataset (*Cleaned_StudentPerformanceFactors.xlsx*) is in the same directory as the script.
2. Open *Data Bytes Code.txt* and copy the script into a Python environment.
3. Update the file path in the script if necessary.
4. Run the script to:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Remove missing values.
   - Convert numeric columns to the correct data type.
   - Perform data visualization.

### 3. Understanding the Report
- The *Data Bytes Report.docx* file provides insights derived from the dataset analysis, including trends and key findings.
